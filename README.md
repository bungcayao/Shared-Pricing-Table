This is or a Pricing Table used for POPin LIVE.
It is built on top of the [Bulma Extension CSS Framework] (https://wikiki.github.io/components/pricingtable/) and styled to fit sketch mockups. This Pricing table is a shared html repo used in an AngularJS Web App and Landing Page (Instangepage Landing Page Editor).

Notables:
- This pricing table tracks URL Parameters, letting us know what campaign, keywords, etc. and generates external links based off of user's origin source. This was part of our way of tracking and capturing analytics through Google Tag Manager, Google Ad Campaigns, and HubSpot.
